Paywhirl lets you accept subscription payments on your Wordpress site.

== Description ==

Paywhirl makes it incredibly easy to create and manage recurring subscription plans. It removes the hard work necessary to code all the views that allow your users to sign-up for memberships, create user accounts and manage their customer subscriptions. Anyone with an existing website can setup our widget in just a few minutes and start collecting recurring payments immediately, whereas with custom development, it can weeks or months to integrate.

1. Get your Paywhirl API key at https://paywhirl.com
1. Upload `paywhirl.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `[paywhirl key=1234567890]` in your templates (replacing 1234567890 with your Paywhirl API key)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I style my widget? =

Of course you can! You can use our Widget Editor to choose your colors and you can upload new icons on your Widget Settings page. We recommend you style your widget to match your website as this provides a better user experience and will increase your number of subscriptions.

= Is Paywhirl in sync with Stripe? =

Paywhirl is setup to be constantly in sync with Stripe. If you change something on Stripe, it will reflect in Paywhirl. Same goes for changing something on Paywhirl - it will be reflected in Stripe. Sometimes this process takes a few seconds.
